# Hi there! :new_moon_with_face:

This is a repository containing all notes and files created while learning to work with Python (Flask) at [AltSchool Africa](https://altschoolafrica.com/schools/engineering).

**Please don't send pull requests**

If you like this structure and want to use it for your own notes, follow these steps: 

- Fork this original repo on GitHub
- Clone from your personal GitHub into the folder you use for AltSchool or Programming on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/altschool-python`
- CD into the cloned folder: `cd altschool-python`
- Add upstream, which links to original GitHub repo: git remote add upstream `https://github.com/Ze-Austin/altschool-python`
- Create and move into a new branch (preferably using your name or GitHub username for this repo): git checkout -b YourName
- Open the folder in your IDE to make your own notes. For VSCode: `code .`
- When you're done for the session, stage your changes on git by adding them: `git add .` or `git add file.name`
- Then commit the staged changes: `git commit -m 'message here'`
- Alternatively, you can add and commit at once: `git commit -am 'message here'`
- Push changes to your branch: `git push origin branchname`
- This is where you'll usually create a pull request on GitHub, but please don't. There's no point in merging everyone's personal notes. But *it would be nice to see everyone's name in the branch list*

Timeline: I usually update this with the week's LMS content by Wednesday evening. Caleb's folder (and any other Flask tutor's) will be updated when they drop files on Slack.
