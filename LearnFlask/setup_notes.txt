How to set up Flask on Mac, as seen on https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask

All code should be run in the Terminal

To set up the environment (and create the project folder) via the terminal, type the code below. Here, LearnFlask is chosen as the environment name:
    python3 -m venv LearnFlask

Then cd into the new project folder and activate the environment:
    . bin/activate

Then install Flask in the project:
    pip install flask

After creating the .py file and coding the project, export FLASK_APP to the .py file:
    export FLASK_APP=projectfilename.py

Run flask:
    flask run

Copy the link created in the terminal and paste it in a browser to open the project on a local server

Press CTRL C to quit running the project on the server

To deactivate Flask in the Terminal: 
    deactivate

Store the requirements in a text file, so that others can run the same code easily:
    pip freeze > requirements.txt

When installing a project gotten elsewhere, install its requirements before running Flask:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
